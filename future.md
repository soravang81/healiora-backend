# Future Implementation Roadmap

## Settings Features - Implementation Difficulty

### âœ… EASY TO IMPLEMENT (Currently Working)
- **Profile Settings**: Basic user information (name, email, phone, timezone, language)
- **Notification Toggles**: Simple on/off switches for email, push, SMS notifications
- **Privacy Settings**: Basic privacy toggles (online status, analytics sharing)
- **Appearance Settings**: Theme selection (light/dark/system), accent color picker
- **Local Storage**: Settings persistence using browser localStorage

### ðŸ”¶ MEDIUM DIFFICULTY (Future Implementation)
- **Avatar Upload**: File upload with image processing and storage
- **Password Change**: Secure password update with validation
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: TOTP/SMS-based 2FA setup
- **Session Management**: View and manage active sessions across devices
- **Data Export**: Download user data in JSON/CSV format
- **Account Deletion**: Secure account deletion with data cleanup

### ðŸ”´ HARD TO IMPLEMENT (Complex Features)
- **Real-time Notifications**: WebSocket-based push notification system
- **SMS Integration**: Third-party SMS service integration (Twilio, AWS SNS)
- **Email Service**: SMTP/SES integration for transactional emails
- **API Key Management**: Secure API key generation and rotation
- **Webhook Management**: Webhook URL validation and testing
- **Advanced Security**: Rate limiting, IP whitelisting, audit logs
- **Multi-language Support**: i18n implementation with dynamic language switching
- **Theme Engine**: Dynamic CSS variable system for custom themes
- **Integration APIs**: Slack, WhatsApp, Discord webhook integrations
- **Analytics Dashboard**: User behavior tracking and analytics
- **Backup & Sync**: Cross-device settings synchronization
- **Advanced Privacy**: GDPR compliance, data retention policies

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Next Sprint)
1. Avatar upload with image processing
2. Password change functionality
3. Basic session management

### Phase 2 (Future Sprints)
1. Two-factor authentication
2. Data export functionality
3. Email notification service

### Phase 3 (Long-term)
1. Real-time notification system
2. Advanced security features
3. Third-party integrations

## Technical Considerations

### Backend Requirements
- File upload service for avatars
- Email service integration
- SMS service integration
- WebSocket server for real-time notifications
- Redis for session management
- Database schema updates for user preferences

### Frontend Requirements
- Image upload component
- Real-time notification handling
- Progressive Web App (PWA) features
- Service worker for offline functionality
- Advanced form validation

### Security Considerations
- File upload security (virus scanning, file type validation)
- Rate limiting for sensitive operations
- CSRF protection
- Secure session management
- Data encryption for sensitive settings

## Notes
- Current implementation uses localStorage for simplicity
- Production should use backend API for all settings
- Consider implementing settings validation on both frontend and backend
- Add proper error handling and user feedback for all operations
- Implement proper loading states and optimistic updates
